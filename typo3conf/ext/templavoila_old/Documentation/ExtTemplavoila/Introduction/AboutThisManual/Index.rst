About this manual
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the release of TemplaVoila 1.0 this manual still remains
incomplete in some parts. But that doesn't mean that there's no
documentation about TemplaVoila ... The following documents will help
you getting started and find the essential information for your work:

- TemplaVoila Manual (this document) – This document always contains a
  complete reference of the configuration options you have. Currently it
  does not contain further information about setting up TemplaVoila
  sites, upgrading or migrating from non TemplaVoila sites.

- `Futuristic Template Building <http://typo3.org/documentation
  /document-library/tutorials/doc_tut_ftb1/current/>`_ – This is a large
  step-by-step tutorial which explains the most important parts of
  TemplaVoila and gets you started with your first TV website. At the
  time of this writing, some information in the tutorial need an update
  so they reflect the new features which were implemented through the
  last year. But still it's worth trying it to get an overview!

- `Localization Guide <http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library
  /core-documentation/doc_l10nguide/current/view/>`_ – A document with
  an in-depth explanation of localization and translation with TYPO3 in
  general. It specifically demonstrates the localization / translation
  features of TemplaVoila.
