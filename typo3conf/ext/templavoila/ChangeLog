2004-08-30 70e5447 Wrong location for this file, belongs to mod3
2004-08-30 4214232 * Merged Kaspers and my changes. * cm2 Added a click menu item for showing on which pages the current content element is used in the pagetree. Bug: If other extensions add click menuitems to second level menus, they will appear here as well (needs core change, is on the ToDo) * mod3: Added a TemplaVoila tools module. Later on this should also contain wizard like converting from old-school to templavoila websites. * mod3: Added wizard for (re-) building indexing information about element reference (where which content element is used). You'll need to update table definitions in the extension manager. * ToDo for element references: Deleting CEs from elsewhere than the page module will not be registered automatically (see ToDo file)
