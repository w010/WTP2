Wolo.pl TYPO3 Pack 2


WTP2 is a preconfigured cms package based on TYPO3.

Originally based on my friend Ry≈ºy's old Million12 package.
The "2" in it's name means it's a second branch, based on TYPO3 6.2. First release was for versions 4.x.

For WTP dedicated to TYPO3 versions 7.x check WTP3 repo.
